# kinneyVBA-Challange

The challenge was to create a VBA script that ran through stock changes throughout a year. This script returns the yearly 
change in stock price as well as the total volume of stocks moved for each company. 

This also completes and additional challenge of identifying and returning the stocks with the largest increase, decrease, 
and total volume over the course of a year.
